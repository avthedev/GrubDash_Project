# GrubDash_Project

This app replicates GrubHub by allowing users to see dishes with their descriptions and being able to add them to their cart. They can also save their address so that they app remembers for delivery purposes.

## Motivation

I developed this as part of my project for the Thinkful Software Engineering course. It is a back-end project that uses Thinkful's front-end starter linked below.

## Demo
